IPBroadcastRealy was developed to rebroadcast client discovery packets from Flex 6000 and 8000 series radios to enable the client to function in a separate broadcast domain from the radio. The software is capable of rebroadcasting any packets, though, given a receiving port on the local machine, a destination port on the remote machine, and a destination IP address. It is additionally capable of managing traffic on multiple ports simultaneously.
